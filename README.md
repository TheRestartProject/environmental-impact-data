# Environmental impact data

This repository contains The Restart Project's Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data: information about the weight and CO2e emissions generated through the production and distribution of a wide range of common consumer products. We use this data to estimate the environmental impact of repairs on the Fixometer, part of our community repair platform [restarters.net](https://restarters.net).

## Background							

This is the second version of our LCA reference data. It was produced in 2021 by a group of volunteers as part of a project to investigate the embodied carbon of common consumer products we see at community repair events. You can learn more about this work here.

If you have any questions about this data, please get in touch with us at: community@therestartproject.org

## About The Restart Project							

The Restart Project is a people-powered social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electronics. We run regular Restart Parties where people teach each other how to repair their broken and slow devices â€“ from tablets to toasters, from iPhones to headphones. We work with schools and organisations to help them value and use their electronics for longer. And we use the data and stories we collect to help demand better, more sustainable electronics for all.
