# Environmental impact data

This repository contains The Restart Project's Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data: information about the weight and CO2e emissions generated through the production and distribution of a wide range of common consumer products. We use this data to estimate the environmental impact of repairs on the Fixometer, part of our community repair platform [restarters.net](https://restarters.net).

## Summary

We collected data on 1406 products. Of these, we have extracted CO2e data on 491 products and product weight data on 824 products. Our focus was on lifecycle assessment (LCA) and Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) reports, as these contained the richest data. However, much of the source data did not contain relevant CO2e or product weight data. The categories of product are based on those defined in the Open Repair Data Standard (ORDS), with the addition of a few unpowered product categories.

Most of this data was sourced directly from product manufacturers, many of whom make this data available in order to secure environmental accreditation, such as EPEAT ecolabels. Other sources include academic papers—primarily papers published in peer-reviewed journals—and public bodies, such as the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME).

For each category, we extracted data from as many products as possible, ensuring we achieved as representative a sample as we could. From these, we calculated an average product weight and pre-use CO2e value for each category. We then evaluated the data availability and data quality for every category using the definitions in the key below.	

See [methodology](methodology.md) for details on the methodology.

## Background							

This is the second version of our LCA reference data. It was produced in 2021 by a group of volunteers as part of a project to investigate the embodied carbon of common consumer products we see at community repair events. You can learn more about this work here.

## About The Restart Project							

The Restart Project is a people-powered social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electronics. We run regular Restart Parties where people teach each other how to repair their broken and slow devices – from tablets to toasters, from iPhones to headphones. We work with schools and organisations to help them value and use their electronics for longer. And we use the data and stories we collect to help demand better, more sustainable electronics for all.
